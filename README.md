# Learning Git

This repository is solely made for the purposes of learning Git. I will be following the instructions in the following book:
[Pro Git by Scott Chaconand Ben Straub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

I intend to finish Chapters 2 - 7 in 2 weeks. I'll also be documenting my learning in this README.md file.
Update: Placing notes in their own markdown to avoid cluttering README.md. Will maintain dates here.

[Day 1 (20-04-2025)](./Day1.md) : Life cycle of file status, init, status, add, commit, remove, ignore

[Day 2 (23-04-2025)](./Day2.md) : git log and its options


[Day 3 (02-05-2025)](./Day3.md) : leant more about git log
