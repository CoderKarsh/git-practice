# Learning Git

This repository is solely made for the purposes of learning Git. I will be following the instructions in the following book:

[Pro Git by Scott Chaconand Ben Straub]https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

I intend to finish Chapters 2 - 7 in 2 weeks. I'll also be documenting my learning in this README.md file.
