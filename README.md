# Learning Git

This repository is solely made for the purposes of learning Git. I will be following the instructions in the following book:
[Pro Git by Scott Chaconand Ben Straub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

I'll also be documenting my learning in this README.md file.
Update: Placing notes in their own markdown to avoid cluttering README.md. Will maintain dates here.
